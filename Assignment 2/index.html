<p>My name is Logan Joerres, I am currently a college student at New England Institute of Technology. My major is Video Game Programming and Design. My goal is to be able to create a video game either on my own or with a very small team. I also want to get a job in my major so I can be financially well enough to sustain myself and the personal goal I have for myself. I originally got the idea to become a game maker after junior year of high school, the reason I came to this decision was because I myself am a gamer. Since I am a gamer I have my own ideas of games I would like to play and maybe if I learn to make games I can make my own world where my own creativity can run wild. 
    Me as a person isn’t very interesting, I don't have many hobbies and I don't really do a whole lot. The main hobby I have is being a gamer. I also have an interest in psychology, and I like to play chess. I picked up chess when I was in middle school, an old teacher of mine named Mr. S taught me how to play, I never beat him though. I picked up the interest in psychology when I was a senior in high school, I took an entry class in high school. Since then I haven’t put more time into learning the field. I got into video games at a very young age, I was about eight when I got a 3D DS. When I was twelve I received my first console, it was an Xbox 360. My first few games I grew up on were Call of Duty Black Ops 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Elder Scrolls 5; Skyrim.
